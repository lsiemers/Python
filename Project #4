Part 1:
Define a function named 'calc' that takes two numbers and an operator and returns 
the calculation result.The operator could be either '+', '-', '/', '*', or '**' 
only. If the operator is "/", then divide the first number by the second. If the 
operator is '**', raise the first number to the second number'th power.

        return num1 - num2      #Returning the Subtraction
    elif operator == "*":
        return num1 * num2      #Returning the Multiplication
    elif operator == "/":
        return num1 / num2      #Returning the Division
    elif operator == "**":
        return num1 ** num2     #Returning the power

Part 2:
The above code will display a menu to the user prompting the user to choose a 
calculation to perform then two numbers. (You can comment them out by selecting the
code and press Ctrl + / when you test the following code and don't want to run this
part because it waits for you to type inputs.) 
After the user enters the two numbers, call 'calc' with the entered numbers and the
corresponding operator. Display the calculation result. You need to map the option 
numbers to the corresponding operators required by the function 'calc'.

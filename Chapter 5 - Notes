#Floor division A//B gives us the qoutient
print(5//3)
print(5/3)

#Modulus (MOD) operator, gives us the remainder of the equation
print(5%3)
print(-5%3)         # negative gives us 1 since -5 = -2 * 3 + r, r(remainder) is always non negative

import math

print(math.remainder(5,3))

#Boolean is either True or False
#Relational Operators: =, ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >
#Operational Operators: and, or, not

print(4>3)
print(6==6 and 3>2)

#IF statements
#if condition:
#   Do something
#Semi-Colon allows us to use multiple statements on one line, so Do someting; Do someting
d=8
if d % 2 == 0: print("D is even")   #Compound statement for displaying

#PASS statement
if d % 3 == 0:
    pass        #this is called a pass statement
